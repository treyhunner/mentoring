            - My name is Trey
            - I help Python &amp; Django teams on-board new teammates and turn their front-end developers into full-stack Django developers.
            - And I run a Python exercise subscription service where where I send out 1 Python exercise every week.  It's called Python Morsels.

        <h2>You're not the star of the show</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - You're not the star of the show
          - It's about your learners not you
          - You're there **to support and guide your learners**, but they shouldn't be reliant upon you
          - I often live code when I teach.  I'm always tempted to write code out and then explain it, but that's not teaching, that's telling.
          - I want you to teach not tell
          - You can do that by encouraging your learners to take things *out of* their heads
          - People don't learn by trying to put knowledge into their heads, but by trying to retrieve knowledge *from* their heads
          - One of the ways that I try to encourage knowledge retrieval with a room full of people is...

        <h2>Mob programming</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Mob programming.
          - With mob programming, my hands are a steering wheel and everyone in the room has a chance to try to steer them
          - I ask folks what I might want to type to get a particular answer and then I for answers to come up
          - Then I type out those answers out to see what happens...
          - And I **purposely choose the wrong answers**
          - One reason for this is that I want you to *encourage your learners to make mistakes*
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Encourage making mistakes</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - If you don't know what your doing, most solutions you'll think up are wrong... but some are right
          - If you try to come up with as many *possible* answers as you can, you can guarantee **you'll find quite a few wrong answers**
          - But you might *also* find a right answer or two
          - So I recommend going out of your way to make mistakes yourself and encouraging your learners to make mistakes as well
          - You shouldn't just allow space to make mistakes: you should encourage mistake-making
          - **Ask people to think up all the plausible answers**, including the ones that probably right
          - This will encourage experimentation and reinforce the fact that playing is fine and you're mostly not going to break things

        <h2><span class="fragment strike" data-fragment-index=1>Delegate to the Documentation</span></h2>
        <h2><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index=1>Delegate to Google</span></h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - After your learners have failed to think up the right answer to their problem, they're going to need to try looking up an answer
          - This often means going to the documentation, though realistically they should probably just go straight to Google
          - The `help()` function is awkward, the search engine on `python.org` is pretty bad, and Google's pretty at search results most of the time
          - I don't just want you to encourage your learners to use the documentation or Google though... I'd like you to **avoid giving answers to questions** by either experimenting (making mistakes) or looking things up in the documentation or in Google
          - If I'm in front of a room live coding and someone asks why the list remove method doesn't seem to do what they'd expect, use the `help` function to jump into the documentation on the list remove method
          - If you're sitting next to someone who you're coaching and they ask "why am I getting this error message?" instead of saying "ah ha, I know the answer", say "let's Google together and see if we find anything useful"
          - Remember that **you're not the star of the show**, you're just an **ally in learning**: you're there to help your learners use the resources they have.
          - *You* are one of their resources, but **you're not their only resources**. And you're a temporary one.
          - That leads me to my next point

        <h2>Be a rubber duck</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Who has heard of rubber duck debugging?
          - This is a technique for bouncing things off of you back into your learner, ensuring the focus is never on you
          - Rubber duck debugging is a technique for debugging your code by walking through it line-by-line with a duck: you explain the code to your duck so that it can help you
          - Of course **the duck doesn't actually help you**, but in the process of elaborating on what's going in your code you'll often find **a new avenue to take to try to solve your problems**
          - I want you to be a rubber duck for your learners: a chatty rubber duck, maybe a Socratic rubber duck
          - If a learner says "my code doesn't work" you can say "what do you expect it to do right now?"
          - Then when they explain that, ask them "what does your code do instead?"
          - Then when you look at the code, ask them what their approach to solving the problem is
          - I don't want you to be a silent rubber duck, **I'd like you to mostly ask questions**

        <h2>Discuss the act of learning</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - And something that's overlooked quite a bit, but I really think is important is to discuss the act of learning itself
          - If you don't how learning works, I have a book to recommend: Make it Stick
          - I said earlier that you don't learn by putting information into your heads but by trying to take it out of your heads
          - I tell that to my learners... because it's easy to forget but remembering this fact helps you focus on learning effectively
          - You're not just there to teach your learners, you're there to help them **be better learners**
          - Another thing that's overlooked often is the growth mindset: this is the idea that your learners aren't good at things yet, but they *will* improve if they put in the effort to do so
          - This is a big one because you need to embrace this too: each of your learners comes from a baseline of understanding.  **You can't judge that baseline**, but that's what they have to work up from.
          - And they will, if you believe that they will and you **let them know that you believe** that they will.  You don't need to do this explicitly, but you need to give the impression of believing in your learners.  If you don't believe in them, you need to convince yourself to: **you must believe in their ability to learn**
          - So embrace the act of learning and discuss how learning works with your learners
          - That's all I've got for you

          - In general, take it slow: slow down your thinking, slow down your acting.
          - Especially when you're in a situation where you're not quite sure *how best to act*, slow down.
          - April Wensel gave a great talk on emotional intelligence last year where she borrowed an analogy about dirt in water. You want to work away from being rapidly moving water and toward being slow-moving water so you can see more clearly and act more intentionally.
          - When you speak, question what you're saying and why
          - Acting with intention requires empathizing: how will your learners react when you say what you're about to say?  Would a different phrasing evoke a different response?
          - This might sound complicated and it can be, so I'd like you to start small.  Start with the interactions that occur frequently or the ones make the most impact.  Some examples that come up quite a bit with me:
            - Why does 
          - Be thoughtful and **be friendly**.  You want your learners to feel encouraged.  Try to foster a genuine sense of enthusiasm and excitement on behalf of your learners:
            - one-on-one explaining to someone who's frustrated or confused: you're doing great and we're about to learn something new
            - as a group letting people know you're
