            - Alright.  Let's get started.
            - So my name is Trey
            - And I help companies increase the knowledge, skills, and comfort level that their developers have with Python
            - I do that in two ways

            - I do on-site team training through my company, Truthful Technology
            - And I run a Python exercise subscription service where where I send out 1 Python exercise every week.  That's called Python Morsels.
            - During this talk I'm going to talk about some of the things I've learned while teaching on-site with companies
            - And I'm also going to draw from my experience TA for Python workshops and a coach at a number of Django Girls workshops

            - who has coached at a Django Girls workshop before? What about another programming workshop before?
            - keep your hands up
            - who has mentored a new hire?
            - who has taught code to someone while sitting next to them?

          - So we're going to talk about a specific scenario that you've probably found yourself in before **(click)**: **you're sitting next to someone and they need with their code**
          - But they don't just want you to fix their code **(click)**, they want to help them improve their skills **(click)**, and some of those are skills that you already have
          - They might need your help again later, but this also might be a temporary relationship: we're focused on the learning moment we have right now **(click)**
          - So during this talk, I'm *not* actually going to talk about Python at all **(click)**
          - I will talk a little about **(click)** study of teaching itself... but not very much **(click)**
          - And as odd as it might sound... I'm also not really going to talk about mentoring **(click)**, at least not the way other folks like Kim Crayton use that term.  We're not focusing on helping someone with big picture goals: we're focused more on helping *in-the-moment* **(click)**
          - So you can think of this more like "coaching" **(click)**
          - So let's get started...

        <h1>Be a Learning Ally</h1>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - When you're coaching someone, **I don't want you to be an expert**, I want you to be an ally in learning
          - Which means...
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>You're not the star of the show</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - You're not the star of the show: you're a side character
          - Your job is **to support and guide your learner**, but they shouldn't be dependent upon you
          - This process is centered around your learners, not you
          - ...

        <h3 class="fragment">"You learn by doing"</h3>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - I often live code when I teach.
          - I'm always tempted to write code out and then explain it, but that's not teaching **(click)**, that's telling.  **(click)**
          - I want you to *teach, not tell*  **(click)**
          - You can do that by encouraging your learners to practice **information retrieval**
          - We don't learn by trying to *put knowledge into our heads*
          - We *learn* by attempting to retrieve knowledge *from* our heads
          - Who has heard the expression "learn by doing" **(click)**... you really *do* learn by *doing*: you learn by trying to take information out of your head and apply it
          - Which is tricky because new you're new to something, you're not good at **the doing** yet
          - And *doing* when **you don't know what you're doing** is intimidating
          - As a mentor, you can make this problem of *not knowing* a little less relevant by **encouraging your learner to make mistakes**
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2><span class="fragment bold">Encourage</span> making mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">"I don't know, give it a try."</li>
          <li class="fragment">"What have you tried so far?"</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Making mistakes involves a *process* of considering what *might be* a correct answer and *what isn't*... and then *trying it out*
          - You're going to be wrong **most of the time**, but doesn't actually matter.  The process matters. This process of trying, getting feedback, and trying again, **that's** a *learning process*
          - I don't just want you to just carve out a space where making mistakes is acceptable, I actually want you to actively *encourage* **(click)** making mistakes... just not using your production database
          - When doing this you could say things like ...
            - **(click)** "I don't know, give it a try"
            - Or **(click)** "what have you tried so far?"
          - You want to reinforce the fact that *playing* is the way learning happens
          - We learn by doing, and doing involves making *a lot* of mistakes
          - ...
          - So after your learners have made mistakes and they've found themselves stuck, I want you to...

        <h3 class="fragment"><em>Make the answers sticky</em></h3>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Not answer any questions... I'm kidding.  You need to help them, that's your job. **(click)** 
          - I do want you to be careful when answering questions though...
          - It's going to be hard to remember that **you shouldn't be telling**, **(click)** you should be teaching **(click)**
          - So when you answer questions, you want your answers to be *sticky* **(click)**
          - Make an analogy, even if it's a bad one.  If it's memorable, it's good enough.
          - If you thought up a dance that demonstrates the way dictionaries work, do it.  I don't know what it would look like, but it would probably be memorable.
          - So make your answers **sticky**
          - And if you can, it's nice to avoid being the source of information
          - You're not the star of the show
          - And whenever reasonably possible, it's nice to *avoid* being the **the source of information**
          - Because **you're not the star of the show**
          - So you want to point your learner in the right direction, which means looking stuff up together...

        <h2><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index=1>Delegate to Google</span></h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - In the documentation
          - Or more realistically, in Google **(click)**
          - If you're sitting next to someone who you're coaching and they ask "why am I getting this error message?" instead of saying "ah ha, I know the answer", say "let's look it up"
          - Who has had someone call you, on your phone, in the middle of the night to ask you a Python question?
          - Hopefully no one.
          - *You* are a resource for your learner, but **you're not their only resource**
          - You want to delegate to longer-lasting sources of information
          - So making mistakes together is important and looking things up together is important...
          - But sometimes you really just need to talk through a problem
          - When you're walking through a problem together, I want you to take inspiration from a friend of mine...

          - I want you to act like this friend here
          - Who has heard of rubber duck debugging?
          - The idea with rubber duck debugging is that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck... actually that's something else
          - Rubber duck debugging is sort of like acting as a sounding board
          - The idea is that you debug your code by walking through it line-by-line with a duck: explaining each line to your rubber duck
          - **The duck doesn't actually help you**, but through the process of elaborating on what's going in your code you'll often find bugs that you hadn't noticed before and thinking of new ideas you haven't explored yet
          - I want you to be a rubber duck for your learners: a chatty rubber duck, maybe a Socratic rubber duck (one that asks questions)
          - If a learner says "my code doesn't work" you can say "what do you expect it to do right now?"
          - Then when they explain that, ask them "what does your code do instead?"
          - Then when you look at the code, ask them what their approach to solving the problem is
          - I don't want you to be a silent rubber duck, but **I'd like you to mostly ask questions**

          - Who has heard of rubber duck debugging?
          - The idea with rubber duck debugging is that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck... actually that's something else
          - If you have a problem, maybe you're debugging your code, talking to your rubber duck can help
          - The duck doesn't talk back, but it listens very well and it encourages you to elaborate on your problem, which is a process that can help you uncover ideas that you haven't explored yet
          - I want you to do a lot more listening to your learner, than talking
          - Encourage elaborating on the problem at hand
          - If your learner says **(click)** "my code doesn't work" you could ask **(click)** what they expect it to do and**(click)**  what it does instead and then follow that up by asking them **(click)** to explain the approach they're taking
          - Elaboration is a great way to learn

          - Also delegate to other sources of information, because the spotlight shouldn't be on you
          - You're not the star of the show.  Your learner is.
          - ...
          - So being a learning ally is important, but this isn't just an intellectual pursuit.  This is an emotional experience.
          - Your learner will be displaying their *lack of knowledge* to you all the time, which means they're going to feel vulnerable... which hard

          - That your learner feels that they can trust you
          - Your learner is in a vulnerable situation
          - They need to feel they can trust you
          - One big way you can build trust, is ...

      <section>
        <h2>Be Vulnerable</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">Telling bad jokes</li>
          <li class="fragment">Making mistakes</li>
          <li class="fragment">Saying "I don't know"</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - By being vulnerable yourself
          - There are a lot of ways to be vulnerable
          - For example, I make bad jokes **(click)**.  They're not usually not very funny.  That makes me a little bit vulnerable.
          - I also make mistakes, sometimes on purpose and most of the time on accident.  But I don't ever "ah I did that on purpose to test you".  I want my learners to *feel* my fallibility.
          - Another big one is saying "I don't know"
            - I don't know, but **let's try it out**
            - Or... I'm not sure, **let's look it up**
          - So vulnerability is a big way to build trust
          - Another big factor in being trusted is the way you speak
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>Speak Deliberately</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">"What does this do?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">"What will happen when we run this?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">"What do you think will happen when we run this?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">"What do you think might happen when we run this?  What's your guess?"</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Here's 4 ways to say almost the same thing...
          - **4 Clicks**
          - There are times when it makes sense to have confident and assertive language that's to-the-point
          - That last way of saying this is welcoming, you're inviting your learner to guess
          - That first one is a test: that's a nerve-wracking way to ask that question
          - You want to quiz people, meaning you want them to practice information retrieval, but you don't want them to **feel like they're being tested**
          - Confident and assertive language has its place, but you want to *invite* your learners to make mistakes and **to guess**
          - So I want you to think about how what you're saying might be interpreted.  Not what you mean, but what might be heard
          - Regardless of how you do this, I definitely want you to try to be **encouraging**
        </aside>

        <h2>Encourage, don't alienate</h2>

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - There are a lot of ways you can alienate you learners, in big ways and in small ways
          - "So obviously" **(click)**, "of course" **(click)**, "it's easy, you just" **(click)**
          - Those are all examples of phrases you might want to avoid
          - When you're learning, very few things are **obvious** and most things **are not easy**
          - That's the whole reason you're learning
          - What's in your head as a mentor, is not in your learners head
          - What's easy for you, is not easy for your learner.  It's hard.
          - Your learner doesn't know things that you do *yet* because they're still in the process of learning
          - *(breathe)* This next slide is the scariest one I have

      <section>
        <h2>Believe in your learners</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - If you don't believe in your learner's ability to improve, they are less likely to improve their skills
          - Who has heard of the growth mindset?
          - If you adopt a growth mindset you believe that through directed effort, you can and you will improve your skills: that your skills aren't fixed but are expandable
          - There's research that backs up the idea that you're more likely to learn if you adopt a growth mindset: you're more likely to grow your skills if you believe in your ability to do so
          - Your belief in your learner is *also very important*: it's hard for your learner to believe in themselves, if you don't believe in them
          - They come from a baseline of understanding that's below yours: you can't judge that baseline, you just **have to believe** that they'll build up from where they're at
          - You need to convince yourself of your learner's abilities and give them the impression, explicitly or implicitly, that you believe in them

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - So building trust involves
            - Being vulnerable
            - Speaking deliberately
            - Which involves making sure you're being encouraging and not alienating
            - And believing in the ability your learner has, to learn.  Believing in their potential and their capacity to grow themselves.
          - ...
          - So to recap, you want to be an learning ally, not an expert
          - You also want to be want to build trust so your learner will be comfortable with you
          - The last thing I want to talk about is a way for you to improve your own mentoring abilities and to learn from yourself as you go
          - The last thing you need to do...

          - Especially when you're in a situation where you're not quite sure *how best to act*, slow down.

        <h2>Reflect</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - When you speak, **question what you're saying and why**
          - Act with intention: try to empathize with what your learner might be feeling
          - It can sometimes be a little distracting to do this too much in the moment, but you should at least take a little bit of time at some point to **reflect on what you're doing** so that you can improve
          - Reflection is an important part of learning, and *you* are learning too

          <li class="fragment">A non-existent (misspelled) function being called</li>
          <li class="fragment">Some code that's poorly styled, but syntactically valid</li>
          <li class="fragment">An error in understanding of the technical requirements</li>
          <li class="fragment">A syntax error that's stopping the code from running at all</li>

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Let's say your learner says: "my code doesn't work"
          - They show you the code, and you see 4 things:
            - A function that's improperly named
            - Code that's a little ugly, but it works
            - Something that seems like a logical error: a misunderstanding in the actual problem you're solving
            - And a syntax error: something that stops the code from running at all
          - Which of these do you focus on?  And which one do you bring up first?
          - I'd argue that last one is the most important *right now*: if you have a syntax error, Python won't let you get any further.
          - And that second one is maybe the least important.  Code style is very important, but whether your code *works* is much more important.  Until that point, talking about code style is just a distraction.  You may not even want to bring up code style *at all* until you have time to make it the primary focus of your conversation.

        <h2>Learn About Learning</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - One thing to do while you're slowing down is to focus on the act of learning itself
          - There are a lot of people who've devoted their careers to improving the learning habits and teaching habits of others.
          - Try to borrow ideas from those people so that you can become better at teaching, but also so that you can help your learner become better at learning.
          - Learn about learning best practices so that you can share them
            - Talk about the growth mindset
            - Talk about the fact that you learn by retrieving information from your head, not by putting it in
            - I have some resources I'll recommend at the end that will help you learn more about learning theory
          - Remember that you're not just there to help your learner improve their programming skills, you're there to help them **become better at learning itself**.
          - Software development usually entails a life long devotion to learning.  It's never too late to improve your learning skills.

        <h2 class="fragment" data-fragment-index=1>Adopt a growth mindset</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - "Fake it until you make it"
          - I don't really like this phrase: I don't really like the connotation... but there is truth behind this idea
          - If you *slow yourself down* and think "if I were a *really good* mentor", you're sort of pretending you're a good mentor... you're faking it
          - But in the process you're trying to act deliberately, you're acting with intention
          - But you're also practicing, which is *part* of learning
          - As you continue to deliberately act a certain way, you'll eventually start to intuitively that act that way
          - Remember the growth mindset **(click)**
          - Mental ability can be learned.  **Thoughfulness**, **empathy**... are learned skills.  **Friendliness**... is a learned skill.
          - Congratulating your learners and feeling excited on their behalf... that's learned too.

        <h2>Slow Down</h2>

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - So I want you to slow yourself down: slow your thinking, speaking, and acting
          - I want you to take things one step at a time: don't distract yourself or your learner by jumping ahead of the one thing that's important right now
          - And I want you to learn a bit about learning itself so that you can help your learners move toward their goals more deliberately
          - I also want you to adopt a growth mindset, not just for your learner's sake but for your sake
          - You can grow your own skills by faking it until you make it
            - If you see a trait you like in someone else, steal it.  It's yours.
          - Whatever being a good mentor means to you, you can move in that direction if you put *your mind* to it
