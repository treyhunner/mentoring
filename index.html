            - My name is Trey
            - I help Python &amp; Django teams on-board new teammates and turn their front-end developers into full-stack Django developers.
            - And I run a Python exercise subscription service where where I send out 1 Python exercise every week.  It's called Python Morsels.

          <li class="fragment">You're helping someone with their <span class="fragment strike">code</span><span class="fragment"> coding abilities</span></li>
          <li class="fragment">This helping relationship might be temporary</li>

          - So I'd like to talk about a specific scenario that you will probably find yourself in at some point if you haven't already: **you are sitting next to someone or you're on a video call with someone, they need with their code, and they think you can help them**
          - They don't just want you to fix their code **(click)**, they want to improve their skills, and some of those are skills that you already have
          - And this moment might be temporary: they might need your help again later, but we're focused on the learning moment we have right now
          - So that's what we're focusing on...
          - During this talk, I'm *not* about Python or any other programming languages for that matter
          - I will talk a little about **(click)** teaching itself... but not very much **(click)**
          - At least not the kinds of things you'll often hear in books on teaching and learning
          - We're mostly going to talk about the human side of mentoring someone else

        <h1>Be a Learning Ally</h1>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - We're talking about helping someone learn
          - This means you're going to make yourself available as a resource
          - This doesn't mean you're going to be the center of attention...

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - You're not the star of the show: you're a side character
          - You're there **to support and guide your learners**, but they shouldn't be reliant upon you
          - This process is centered around your learners, not you
          - You don't want to be an expert, you want to be a learning ally
          - ...
          - I often live code when I teach.  I'm always tempted to write code out and then explain it, but that's not teaching, that's telling.
          - I want you to teach not tell

        <h2>Teach, don't tell</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - You can do that by encouraging your learners to take things *out of* their heads
          - We don't learn by trying to put knowledge into our heads, we learn by attempting to retrieve knowledge *from* our heads
          - You really *do* learn by doing
          - Which is tricky because new you're new to something, you're not good at the doing yet
          - *Doing* when you don't know what you're doing is intimidating
          - As a mentor, you can make this problem of *not knowing* a little less relevant by encouraging your learners to make mistakes

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Mistakes aren't magical, but the **process of making mistakes** is really helpful for learning
          - If you don't know what your doing, most solutions you'll think up *are wrong*... but **some are right**
          - Making mistakes involves a process of considering what *might be* a correct answer and *what isn't*: **that** is a learning process
          - It's important to allow for the space to make mistakes, but I'd like you to go beyond that
          - I want you to actively **encourage** mistake-making **(click)**
          - Say things like ... **(click)** ... **(click)**
          - You want to reinforce the fact that *playing* is the way learning happens
          - We learn by doing, and doing involves making *a lot* of mistakes
          - So after your learners have made mistakes and they've found themselves stuck, I want you to...

          - Not answer any questions... just kidding.  You need to help them, that's your job. **(click)** 
          - I do want you to be careful when answering questions though...
          - It's going to be hard to remember that **you shouldn't be telling**, **(click)** you should be teaching **(click)**
          - This doesn't mean you shouldn't answer questions, but when you do answer questions **you want the answer to be sticky**
          - And whenever reasonably possible, it's nice to *avoid* being the **the source of information**
          - Because **you're not the star of the show**, you're just one of their **allies in learning**: you're there to help your learners use the resources they have
          - *You* are one of their resources, but **you're not their only resources**
          - So you want to point your learners in the right direction
          - Often this means, looking stuff up together...

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - In the documentation
          - Well... sometimes.  As good documentation can be, Google **(click)** is often better
          - The `help()` function is awkward in Python and the search feature on `python.org` is pretty bad, but Google's search results are pretty good most of the time
          - If you're sitting next to someone who you're coaching and they ask "why am I getting this error message?" instead of saying "ah ha, I know the answer", say "let's Google together and see if we find anything useful"
          - So making mistakes together is important and looking things up together is important...
          - But sometimes you really just need to talk through a problem.  Sometimes what your learners really need is a duck.

        <h2>Be a rubber duck</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Who has heard of rubber duck debugging?
          - Rubber duck debugging is sort of like acting as a sounding board
          - The idea is that you debug your code by walking through it line-by-line with a duck: explaining each line to your rubber duck
          - **The duck doesn't actually help you**, but through the process of elaborating on what's going in your code you'll often find bugs that you hadn't noticed before and thinking of new ideas you haven't explored yet
          - I want you to be a rubber duck for your learners: a chatty rubber duck, maybe a Socratic rubber duck (one that asks questions)
          - If a learner says "my code doesn't work" you can say "what do you expect it to do right now?"
          - Then when they explain that, ask them "what does your code do instead?"
          - Then when you look at the code, ask them what their approach to solving the problem is
          - I don't want you to be a silent rubber duck, but **I'd like you to mostly ask questions**

          - Being a learning ally is important, but learning isn't just an intellectual pursuit, it's an emotional one
          - Your learner is doing something hard and they're in sort of a vulnerable position with you because they're exposing their lack of knowledge

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Vulnerability is a really big part of building trust.  Being vulnerable is being human.
          - There are a lot of ways to be vulnerable.  You'll need to find the ones that work for you.
          - For example, I make bad jokes.  Sometimes, if **no one laughs at my bad jokes**, I point out the fact that I just made a joke that no laughed at.  And that makes things even more awkward.
          - But it makes me vulnerable which makes me seem more human which builds trust
          - I also make mistakes, sometimes on purpose and sometimes on accident.  But I don't ever "ah I did that on purpose to test you".  I want my learners to *feel* my fallibility.  That makes me human.
          - I don't know, let's find out - Shannon Turner
          - I don't know, but let's try it out
          - I'm not sure, let's try it
          - I don't know, let's Google it
          - I don't know, let's look it up
          - Vulnerability is powerful

          - Here's 4 ways to say almost the same thing...
          - **4 Clicks**
            - "What will this code do?" vs "What could this code do?  What are the possibilities?"
          - Confident and assertive language has its place, but you want to *invite* your learners to make mistakes and **to guess**
          - That last way of saying this is welcoming, you're inviting your learner to guess
          - That first one is a test: that's a nerve-wracking way to ask that question
          - You want to quiz people: by that I mean you want them to try to retrieve information from their heads
          - But you **don't want people to feel like they're being quizzed**
          - TODO
            - Sometimes hedged language that's lacking in confidence or assertiveness can be more inviting and more reassuring
            - This is very situational and it definitely takes playing with to figure out what seems to work best for you, your learners, and the situation that you're in
          - Regardless of how you do this, I definitely want you to try to be **encouraging**

          - "So obviously" **(click)**, "of course" **(click)**, "it's easy, you just" **(click)**
          - Those are all utterances you might want to avoid
          - When you're learning, very few things are **obvious** and most things **are not easy**
          - That's the whole reason you're learning
          - What's in your head as a mentor, is not in your learners head
          - What's easy for you, is not easy for your learner.  It's hard.
          - Who has heard of the growth mindset?
          - If you adopt a growth mindset you believe that through directed effort, you can and you will improve your skills: that your skills aren't fixed but are expandable
          - It's important that you adopt a sort of vicarious growth mindset: you need to be believe that your learners can and *will* improve their skills
          - This will help you *remember* that you learners don't know things yet because they're still learning, but more importantly... it'll *make you believe in your learner's ability to grow*

          - *(breathe)* This is the scary slide *(pause)*
          - If you don't believe in your learners ability to improve, they might not improve
          - People who adopt a growth mindset are more likely to grow their skills: if you think your skills can grow, you're more likely to keep trying until they really do
          - If you have a mentor who you trust and they believe your abilities can grow and they show it, you're a lot more likely to believe it as well
          - If you've been thinking "carefully choosing my words seems really complicated", consider how hard it would be to careful choose your words, your body language, and your tone of voice to mask that fact that you don't believe in someone else's ability
          - You really need to genuinely believe in the abilities of your learners.  So try to convince yourself of their abilities: it could help them a lot

        <h1>Slow Down</h1>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Is slow down
          - I want you to slow down your thinking, slow down your speaking, slow down your acting
          - Especially when you're in a situation where you're not quite sure *how best to act*, slow down.
          - April Wensel gave a great talk on emotional intelligence last year where she borrowed an analogy about dirt in water. You want to work away from being rapidly moving water and toward being slow-moving water so you can see more clearly and act more intentionally.

          - When you speak, **question what you're saying and why**
          - It can sometimes be a little distracting to do this too much in the moment, but you should at least reflect on what you're doing so that you can improve
          - Reflection is an important part of learning, and *you* are learning too
          - Acting with intention requires empathizing: how will your learners react when you say what you're about to say?  Would a different phrasing evoke a different response?
          - This might sound complicated and it can be, so I'd like you to start small.  **Start with the interactions that occur frequently** or **the ones make the most impact** *(examples?)*

            - A function that's improperly named
            - Code that's a little ugly, but it works
            - Something that seems like a logical error: a misunderstanding in the actual problem you're solving

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - And something that's overlooked quite a bit, but I really think is important is to discuss the act of learning itself
          - If you don't how learning works, I have a book to recommend: Make it Stick
          - I said earlier that you don't learn by putting information into your heads but by trying to take it out of your heads
          - I tell that to my learners... because it's easy to forget but remembering this fact helps you focus on learning effectively
          - You're not just there to teach your learners, you're there to help them **be better learners**
          - Another thing that's overlooked often is the growth mindset: this is the idea that your learners aren't good at things yet, but they *will* improve if they put in the effort to do so
          - This is a big one because you need to embrace this too: each of your learners comes from a baseline of understanding.  **You can't judge that baseline**, but that's what they have to work up from.
          - And they will, if you believe that they will and you **let them know that you believe** that they will.  You don't need to do this explicitly, but you need to give the impression of believing in your learners.  If you don't believe in them, you need to convince yourself to: **you must believe in their ability to learn**
          - So embrace the act of learning and discuss how learning works with your learners
          - That's all I've got for you

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - People sometimes say "fake it until you make it"
          - I don't really like this phrase: I just don't the connotation... but there is truth behind this idea
          - If you *slow yourself down* and think "if I was a good mentor", "what might I do in this situation", you're sort of pretending you're a good mentor... you're faking it
          - But in the process you're trying to act deliberately, you're acting with intention
          - But you're also practicing, which is *part* of learning
          - As you continue to deliberately act a certain way, you'll eventually start to intuitively that act that way
