            - Alright.  Let's get started.
            - So my name is Trey
            - And I help developers level-up their Python skills
            - I do that in two ways

            - I run a weekly Python skill-building service called Python Morsels
            - I also do on-site trainings to help teams level-up their Python skills
            - I'm going to be talking about some of the things I've learned while teaching Python to teams
            - I'll also be drawing heavily from my experience organizing and coaching at programming workshops

            - When it comes to coaching, mentoring, and teaching, I often don't feel like I know what I'm doing (I don't have formal teaching credentials)

            - So we're going to talk about a specific scenario **(click)**: you're **sitting next to someone** and **they need your help** with *their* code
            - They don't just want you to *fix* their code **(click)**, they want your help growing their coding skills **(click)**
            - They *might* need your help again later, but this relationship might be temporary **(click)**: we're focused on the learning moment we have right now
            - What I won't be talking about during this talk, is *Python* **(click)**
            - I will talk a little bit about **(click)** teaching itself... but not very much **(click)**
            - And, while this talk is called meaningful mentoring moments, ... I'm not really going to talk about mentoring **(click)**, at least not the way other folks like Kim Crayton use that term
            - This *might* be a big picture, long term mentoring relationship: but we're only going to focus on helping **in-the-moment we have right now** **(click)**
            - So you can think of this more like "coaching" **(click)** (which is what Django Girls often calls this)

          - *teach, don't tell*  **(click)**
          - You can do that by encouraging **active recall**: that's the act of retrieving information from your head

          - To make mistakes
          - Making mistakes involves a *process* of considering what *might be* a correct answer and *what isn't*... and then *trying it out*
          - The process of trying, failing, and trying again is a *learning* process
          - I don't just want you to just carve out a space where making mistakes is okay, I actually want you to actively *encourage* **(click)** making mistakes
          - When doing this you could say things like ...
            - **(click)** "I don't know, give it a *try*" (which is code for "let's make a mistake together")
            - Or **(click)** "what have you tried so far?" (which means "what mistakes have you made so made so far")
          - So I want you to actively encourage your learners to make mistakes

          - It's going to be hard to remember that **you shouldn't be telling**, **(click)** you should be teaching **(click)**
          - So when you answer questions, you want your answers to be *sticky* **(click)**
          - Make an analogy, even if it's a bad one.  If it's memorable, it's good enough.
          - If you thought up a dance that demonstrates the way dictionaries work, do it.  I don't know what it would look like, but it would probably be memorable.
          - Make your answers **sticky**
          - And if you can, it's nice to avoid being the source of information.  Instead of answering questions directly, point your learner in the right direction...

          - *You* are a resource for your learner, but **you're not their only resource**
          - You want to delegate to other sources of information that are more accessible at 2am... or over the weekend

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - With rubber duck debugging, when you get stuck on a coding problem you talk to you rubber duck
          - Your rubber duck doesn't talk back to you, it just listens
          - So the duck doesn't answer any questions, but talking to the duck helps you elaborate on your problem which can help you uncover ideas you hadn't thought of yet
          - I want you to do a lot more listening to your learner, than talking
          - So if your learner says **(click)** "my code doesn't work" you could ask **(click)** what they expect it to do and**(click)**  what it does instead and then follow that up by asking them **(click)** to explain the approach they're taking
          - Elaboration is a great way to learn

          - You're not the star of the show.  **(click)** Your learner is.

          - So being a learning ally is important, but learning isn't just **an intellectual pursuit**.  This is an **emotional experience** (for your learner and maybe for you).
          - Who remembers learning a new technology and not having any idea what you were doing?
          - Your learner is **living** that moment.  They're going to be displaying their *lack of knowledge* to you, over &amp; over.

          - For example, I make bad jokes **(click)**.  They're not usually not very funny and that makes me a little bit vulnerable.
          - I also make mistakes **(click)**, sometimes on purpose and most of the time on accident.  But I don't ever "I did that on purpose to test you".  I want my learners to *feel* my fallibility.
          - Another big way to be vulnerable is by saying *"I. don't. know"* **(click)**
            - I don't know, but **let's try it out**
            - Or... I'm not sure, **let's look it up**

          - Those first and second ones sound kind of like a **pop quiz**
          - Active recall is how we learn: so you *do* want to quiz your learner, but you don't want them to **feel like they're being quizzed**
          - You want to invite your learners *to guess* and *to make mistakes* by using welcoming language, not confident or assertive language

            - And believing in the ability your learner has, to learn.  Believing in their potential and their capacity to grow themselves.
          - ...
          - So to recap, you want to be an learning ally, not an expert
          - You also want to be want to build trust so your learner will be comfortable with you
          - ...
          - The last thing I'd like to talk about is a way for you to improve your mentoring abilities by learning from yourself as you go
          - The last thing I'd like you to do...

          - Is slow down
          - *(long pause)*
          - *(continued pause)*
          - TODO more pauses like this: June said so
          - I want you to slow down...
            - your thinking
            - your speaking
            - and your actions
          - *Especially* when you're in a situation where you're *not* quite sure *how* to act

          - Let's say your learner says: "my code doesn't work"
          - They show you the code, and you see 4 things:
            - **(click)** A function that's improperly named
            - **(click)** Code that's a little ugly, but it works
            - **(click)** Something that seems like a logical error: a misunderstanding of the problem you're solving
            - **(click)** And a syntax error: something that stops the code from running at all
          - Which one of these do you focus on?
          - **Trick question**.  The answer is actually whichever one is currently most important to your learner
          - Unless they're asking you about code style, that's not the most pressing issue of these four **(*elaborate*)** **(click)**
          - The most important *right now* might be the one Python is *complaining* about: the syntax error **(click)**
          - You don't want to distract your learner: so just focus on *the one thing* that's important *right now*.  And then stop.  *The rest* can come later.
          - TODO one thing priority visual then stop sign visual?

          - When you speak, *question* **what you're saying** and **why you're saying it**
          - ...
          - Reflecting on your actions and words *in-the-moment* **can** be distracting, but do try to slow down and reflect from time-to-time
          - *Reflection* is a very *important* part of learning, and *you* are also learning

          - TODO visuals
          - One thing you should consider doing, is learning **(click)** about learning
          - I recommend learning about the best practices around learning
          - This is useful for you because *you* are learning
          - But it'll also be useful to share these concepts with your learner
            - Talk about the growth mindset
            - And talk about the fact that you learn by retrieving information from your head, not by putting it into your head
          - This discussion is a *moment* for you, but *it's a lifetime* for your learner

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - "Fake it until you make it"
          - I don't really like this phrase: it sounds maybe insincere or demeaning somehow.
          - But there is some truth to this idea
          - Faking it until you make it, is kind of related to adopting a growth mindset **(click)**
          - If you *slow yourself down* and think "if I were a *really good* mentor, what would I do", you're fake it
          - You're acting deliberately: you're pretending
          - But you're also practicing: which means you're learning
          - So you won't be pretending, because it'll be intuitive
          - *Faking it* is a way to grow yourself
          - ...
          - Many mental abilities are learned skills
          - **Thoughfulness**, **empathy**, **friendliness**: all of those are *learned* skills.
          - Lots of things seem like they're inherent parts of our personality: but many things can be changed if you put in the right kind of effort

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - So I want you to slow yourself down: slow your thinking, your speaking, and your acting
          - I want you to take things one step at a time: don't distract yourself or your learner by jumping ahead of the **one thing** that's important right now
          - And I want you to learn a bit about learning itself so that you can help your learners move toward their goals more deliberately
          - I also want you to adopt a growth mindset, not just for your learner's sake but for your sake
          - If you identify a trait in someone else that you like, steal it.  It's yours.  You can fake it until one day you have that trait also.
          - Whatever being a good mentor means to you, you *can* move in that direction if you **put your mind to it**
