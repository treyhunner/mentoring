            - I run Python Morsels **(click)**, which is a weekly exercise service that helps developers deepen their Python skills in ways that day-to-day coding doesn't
            - I also run a training company, Truthful Technology **(click)**, which gives the me opportunity to help ye clients level-up their team's Python skills through hands-on training sessions
            - I'm going to be talking about some of the things I've learned while teaching Python to teams
            - I'll also be drawing on my experience organizing meetups and coaching at volunteer-run Python and Django workshops over the years
            - **Disclaimer**: I don't have a background in teaching teachers, *but* I have learned a few things over the years about teaching, coaching, and mentoring that I feel qualified enough to share...

            - Who has mentored a new hire or a new team member?
            - I hope those of you raised your hands will find this talk useful the next time you find yourself mentoring a new teammate
            - For those who didn't raise your hands, you will probably one day find yourself helping a colleague with their code... at that point I hope you'll reflect on what we're about to discuss

            - We're going to talk about a specific scenario **(click)**: you're **sitting next to someone** and **they need your help** with *their* code
            - They don't just want you to *fix* their code **(click)**, they want your help growing their coding skills **(click)**
            - They *might* need your help again later, but this relationship might be temporary **(click)**: we're focused on the learning moment we have right now
            - What I won't be talking about during this talk, is *Python* **(click)**
            - I will talk a little bit about **(click)** teaching itself... but not very much **(click)**
            - And, I've called my talk "meaningful mentoring moments", ... I'm not *really* going to talk about mentoring **(click)**, at least not the way that word "mentoring" is *usually* used
            - Mentoring is *often* be a big picture, long term mentoring relationship: but my advice here will be focused *primarily* on helping **in-the-moment we have right now** **(click)**
            - So instead of "mentoring", you can think of this more like "coaching" **(click)**
            - ...
            - There are three big topics we're going to discuss.

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - When I hold a Python training session, whether at a conference or for one of my clients
          - I almost always *live code* as I teach
          - And I'm always tempted to *write code out* and then *explain* it, but that's not teaching **(click)**... that's telling.  **(click)**
          - I don't want you to tell; I want you *to teach*  **(click)**
          - You can do that by encouraging **active recall**: that's the act of retrieving information from your head
          - ...
          - We **don't learn** by trying to *put information into our heads*
          - We *learn* by attempting to retrieve information *from* our heads

          - *(pause)* It's true.
          - The reason it's true is that **doing** requires the act of **retrieving information from our heads**
          - You don't learn by consuming information, you learn by retrieving it: it's the doing that makes the learning stick
          - ...
          - This is tricky because *doing* is **intimidating** when you don't yet *know* what you're doing.

          - To make mistakes
          - Making mistakes involves a *process* of *considering possible solutions*...
          - What *might be* a correct answer and which possible answer seems like the next best guess; and then **try it out**
          - The process of trying, failing, and trying again is a *learning* process
          - To be clear I don't just want you to just carve out a space where making mistakes is okay
          - I want you to actively *encourage* **(click)** making mistakes
          - **mistakes are magical** because mistakes usually involve *experimenting* **(click)**
          - We **take a guess** and then we **try it out** to validate, or *more often* to **invalidate**, our guess because **most guesses** are incorrect and that's just part of learning
          - To encourage experimenting you could say things like ...
            - **(click)** "I don't know, give it a *try*" (which is code for "let's make a mistake together")
            - Or **(click)** "what have you tried so far?" (which means "what mistakes have you made up to this point")
          - ...
          - After your learner has made a mistake (maybe you've even made a mistake together), at some point they will (inevitably) find themselves stuck

          - To not answer any questions... *(pause)*
          - ...I'm kidding, you actually do need to answer questions **(click)**
          - Answering questions is an important part of coaching
          - But I want you to **be careful** when answering questions
          - It's going to be hard to remember that **you shouldn't be telling**, **(click)** you should be teaching **(click)**
          - So when you answer questions, you want your answers to be *sticky* **(click)**
          - For example you could make an analogy
          - Analogies can be very sticky, especially bad analogies
          - The **more memorable** it is, the better: memorable moments are sticky moments
          - If you thought up a dance that demonstrates the way dictionaries work, do it.  I don't know what it would look like, but it would probably be memorable.
          - Make your answers **sticky**
          . ...
          - And when possible, while giving answers, it's nice to avoid being the source of information.
          - ... to not give an answer directly but to go on a learning adventure together...
          - You can do that by pointing your learner in the right direction by...

          - If you're on a call with a coworker and they ask "why am I getting this error message?" instead of saying "ah ha, I know the answer", you could say "let's look it up"
          - You may *know* the answer, but looking up the answer encourages your learner to **form a habit of delegating to helpful resources**
          - *You* are a resource for your learner, but **you're not their only resource**
          - You want to delegate to other sources of information that are more accessible at 2am... or over the weekend
          - I don't know about you but while I love answering Python questions, I'd prefer not to answer them in the middle of the night

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Rubber duck debugging is the idea that when you get stuck on a coding problem you talk to a rubber duck
          - Your rubber duck doesn't talk back to you (at least *hopefully* it doesn't talk back)
          - Your rubber duck isn't supposed to talk back; it just listens
          - Your duck doesn't answer any questions, but talking to the duck helps you **elaborate** on your problem which can help you **uncover** ideas you hadn't thought of yet
          - I don't want you to be completely *silent* like a rubber duck, but I want you to do **a lot more listening** than talking **(click)**
          - So if your learner says **(click)** "my code doesn't work" you could ask **(click)** what they expect it to do and**(click)**  what it does instead and then follow that up by asking them **(click)** to explain the approach they're taking... to **talk through** the problem with you
          - For you that means less talking and more listening
          - Elaboration is a great way to learn and you can help with elaboration by **acting a bit like a rubber duck**

          - So being a learning ally is important, but learning isn't just **an intellectual pursuit**.  It's also an **emotional experience** (for your learner and maybe also for you).
          - Who remembers learning a new technology and not having **any idea** what you were doing?
          - Your learner may be **living** that moment, maybe not all the time but probably *some* of the time
          - Regardless of how secure or insecure your they feel about what they know and don't know...
          - They're going to be displaying *a lack of knowledge* to **you**, over &amp; over (if you're doing your job right)

          - That you build trust with your learner
          - Whenever you're helping someone learn something that *you* know better than they do, you'll be be *perceived* as an **authority figure**
          - And we typically experience *authority figures* as *intimidating*
          - You need to find a way to **overcome that intimidation factor**
          - Your learner needs to feel comfortable being **vulnerable** with you
          - They need to trust you
          - One *big* way you can build trust, is to find a way to make **yourself** more vulnerable
        </aside>

        <h2>Be Vulnerable</h2>

          <li class="fragment">Making mistakes</li>
          <li class="fragment">Saying "I don't know"</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - There are a lot of ways to make yourself a bit more vulnerable
          - For example, when I'm teaching Python...
          - I often make bad jokes **(click)**.  They're not usually not very funny, sometimes they've even a bit absurd
          - That breaks up tension a bit, but it also makes *me* a little bit more vulnerable
          - I also make mistakes **(click)**, sometimes on purpose... most of the time on accident, partly because I'm live coding and you can't live code *without* making mistakes
          - But when I make a mistake (even if it's on purpose) I never ever say "I did that on purpose to test you"
          - I want my learners to *feel* my fallibility: it helps them *more* than telling them that I made a mistake to test them
          - Another big way to be vulnerable is by saying *"I. don't. know"* **(click)**
            - I don't know, but **let's try it out**
            - Or... I'm not sure, **let's look it up**
          - Admitting you don't know is important for building trust
          - ...
          - These are just 3 ways to be more vulnerable
          - And vulnerability is a big way to build trust... but it's not the only way
          - Another big factor in being trusted is **considering the way you that speak**

        </ol>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Here are 4 ways to ask almost the same thing...
          - **4 Clicks, slowly**
          - Which of these is the most **welcoming**? *(pause)*
          - I would say probably number 4: it's long and awkward but it's most clearly in the realm of *guessing* and *experimenting* rather than *knowing*
          - Those first and second questions sound a bit like a **pop quiz**
          - Active recall is how we learn: so you *do* want to quiz your learner, but you don't need them to **feel like they're being quizzed**
          - There's no need to increase the intimidation factor by adding the feeling of being tested
          - You want to invite your learners *to guess* and *to make mistakes* by using welcoming and inviting language, not confident or assertive language
          - *Confident* and *assertive* language has its place, but you'll do much better with *welcome* and *inviting* language when you're trying to encourage guessing
          - ...
          - I want you to think a bit less about what you're *saying* and a bit more about how what you're saying *might be heard*
          - To that end, I want you to be **encouraging**

          - There are a lot of ways you can alienate you learner (in big ways and in small ways) through the words you use
          - Here are some problematic phrases I've often caught myself using...
          - "So obviously" **(click)**: many things are **not obvious** when you're learning
          - If you're *talking about* something, it's *not* completely obvious
          - "Of course" **(click)**: this one's a bit more subtle... when you're new to something, there often aren't very many "of course" situations because (again) many things aren't yet obvious
          - "It's easy, you just" **(click)**: it's easy for you, it's not easy if you don't know it yet
          - What's in your head, may not be in your learner's head
          - Your learner doesn't yet know the same things you do, because you're probably further along in your learning process
          - ... *(breathe)*
          - ...
          - This next slide is the scariest one because it could be a big barrier in your effectiveness as a mentor or a coach

        <h2>You must believe in your learners</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - If you don't believe in your learner's ability to improve, they are less likely to improve their skills
          - Who has heard of the growth mindset?
          - If you adopt a growth mindset you believe that through directed effort, you can and you will improve your skills: that your skills aren't fixed but are expandable
          - The interesting thing about the growth mindset, is that...
          - You're more likely to learn if you adopt a growth mindset: you're more likely to grow your skills if you believe in your ability to do so
          - And it's hard to believe in yourself if the person who's coaching you doesn't believe in you
          - Your learner is starting from a *baseline of understanding*: you can't judge that baseline, you just **have to believe** that they'll build up from where they're at right now
          - And you need to give your learner the impression, explicitly or implicitly, that you believe in their ability to grow their own skills

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Building trust involves
            - Being vulnerable **(click)**
            - Possibly by telling bad jokes
            - And speaking deliberately **(click)**
            - Which involves making sure you're being encouraging and not alienating **(click)** the person you're working with
            - And believing in the ability your learner has, to learn. **(click)**  Believing in their potential and their capacity to grow themselves.

          - Is slow down
          - *(long pause)*
          - *(continued pause)*
          - I want you to slow down...
            - your thinking
            - your speaking
            - and your actions
          - *Especially* when you're in a situation where you're *not* quite sure *how* to act

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Let's say your learner says: "my code doesn't work"
          - They show you the code, and you see 4 things:
            - **(click)** A function that's improperly named
            - **(click)** Code that's a little bit ugly, but it works
            - **(click)** Something that seems like a logical error: a misunderstanding of the problem you're solving
            - **(click)** And a syntax error: something that stops the code from running at all
          - *(pause)* ...
          - Which one of these do you focus on first? What do you think?
          - ...
          - **This actually is a trick question**: it's a trick question because you want to focus on whatever is currently *hanging up* your learner
          - Code style is *probably* not hanging up your learner because if they have these 4 problems, they're probably not asking about code style **(click)**
          - Code style is often a topic that you can leave for another day: talk about it at some point but if you have these 4 problems code style is not your top concern
          - The thing your learner is probably concerned about is **that syntax error**: **(click)** your learner will probably notice that first because Python will notice that first
          - The most important *right now* is the one thing you should focus on next
          - What that *one thing* is depends on what your learner is most concerned about right now
          - You don't want to distract: so just focus on *the one thing* that's important *right now*.  And then stop.
          - *(pause)*
          - *The rest* can come later.

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - You're going to be better at knowing what to focus on next if you can *empathize* with your learner and imagine what your *they* might be feeling
          - To accomplish that you can slow down, and reflect **(click)**
          - When you speak, *question* **what you're saying**, **why you're saying it**, and how it might be heard
          - ...
          . ...
          - Reflecting on your actions and words *in-the-moment* **can** be distracting... I don't want you to get hung up on constantly analyzing your actions in the moment
          - But you should try to find a way to carve out some space for yourself every once in a while to *marinate in the moment you're in*
          - Think about what it is you're doing, what you've just done, and where you might be going next
          - *Reflection* is a very *important* part of learning, and *you* are also learning

        <h2 class="fragment">Learn About Learning</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Another thing to consider doing, is learning **(click)** about learning
          - There are *a lot* of folks who write about learning best practices the same way developers write about programming best practices
          - These best practices will be useful for you because *you* are learning
          - But it'll also be useful to share these concepts with your learner
          - For example you can...
            - Talk about the growth mindset: that is the fact that believing you can grow your skills actually *helps you* grow your skills
            - And you can talk about the fact that **you don't learn by putting information in your head**: you learn by **retrieving information from your head**. The information retrieval process is where learning actually happens
          - A discussion about learning might be a *moment* for you, but *a lifetime* for your learner
          - Improving your your learner's ability to learn will also impact their on-going programming career as well

        <h2 class="fragment" data-fragment-index=1>Adopt a growth mindset</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - "Fake it until you make it"
          - I don't really like this phrase: it sounds a bit insincere or maybe demeaning
          - The connotation seems a bit off to me...
          - But there is some truth to this idea
          - Faking it until you make it, is kind of related to adopting a growth mindset **(click)**
          - If you *slow yourself down* and think "if I were a *really good* mentor, what would I be doing right now", **you're faking it**
          - You're acting deliberately: you're pretending
          - But you're also *practicing*: which means you're learning
          - So eventually you you won't need to fake it because it'll be intuitive
          - *Faking it* is just another way of talking about the growth mindset
          - ...
          - Many mental abilities are learned skills
          - **Thoughfulness** is a learned skill
          - **empathy** is a learned skill
          - **friendliness** is something you can learn
          - I am a friendlier person than I used to be. I've been faking it for years and at some point I internalized a bit of friendliness.
          - Lots of things seem like they're inherent parts of our personality: but many things can be changed if you put in the right kind of effort
          - If you identify a trait in someone else that you like, steal it.  It's yours.  You can fake it until one day you also have that trait.

          - Slow yourself down
          - Slow down your thinking, your speaking, and your actions
          - Take things one step at a time: don't distract yourself or your learner by jumping ahead of the **one thing** that's important right now
          - And learn a bit about learning itself so that you can help your learners move toward their goals more deliberately
          - Also, be sure to adopt a growth mindset, for your learner's sake but also for your sake
          - You can grow and improve in your mentoring abilities just as your learner can grow and improve in their Python abilities
          - Whatever being a good mentor means to you, you *can* move in that direction if you **put in the right effort to do so**
