            - Alright.  Let's get started.
            - So my name is Trey
            - And I help companies increase the knowledge, skills, and comfort level that their developers have with Python
            - I do that in two ways

            - I run a weekly Python skill-building service called Python Morsels.  If you like my logo as much as I do, come find me afterward because I have stickers.
            - I also do on-site team training to help teams level-up their Python skills
            - I'm going to be talking about some of the things I've learned while teaching Python to teams
            - I'll also be drawing heavily from my experience organizing and coaching at Python and Django workshops
            - When it comes to coaching, mentoring, and teaching, I don't feel like I know what I'm doing

            - ...Including Django Girls workshops
            - I've coached at 2 Django Girls events and I've acted as a coach mentor and meta-coach for 3 more Django Girls events
            - When it comes to coaching, mentoring, and teaching, I often don't feel like I know what I'm doing... but I have learned some things that I feel qualified enough to share

            - ... Keep your hands up
            - Who has mentored a new hire at work?
            - I hope those of you raising your hands, will find this talk relevant for the next time you find yourself in a similar situation

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - So we're going to talk about a specific scenario **(click)**: you're **sitting next to someone** and **they need your help** with *their* code
          - They don't just want you to *fix* their code **(click)**, they want your help growing their coding skills **(click)**
          - They *might* need your help again later, but this relationship might be temporary **(click)**: we're focused on the learning moment we have right now
          - What I won't be talking about during this talk, is *Python* **(click)**
          - I will talk a little bit about **(click)** teaching itself... but not very much **(click)**
          - And, while this talk is called meaningful mentoring moments, ... I'm not really going to talk about mentoring **(click)**, at least not the way other folks like Kim Crayton use that term
          - This *might* be a big picture, long term mentoring relationship: but we're only going to focus on helping **in-the-moment we have right now** **(click)**
          - So you can think of this more like "coaching" **(click)**
          - There are three big topics I'd like to discuss.  The first one...

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Is being an ally in learning
          - When you're coaching someone, **I don't want you to be an expert**, I want you to be an ally
          - Because...

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - You're not the star of the show: you're a side character
          - Your job is **to support and guide your learner**, but they *shouldn't* be *dependent* upon you
          - This process is **centered around your learners**, not you
          - ...
          - So...

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - I often live code when I teach
          - And I'm always tempted to *write code out* and then *explain* it, but that's not teaching **(click)**... that's telling.  **(click)**
          - *teach, don't tell*  **(click)**
          - You can do that by encouraging your learners to practice **information retrieval**
          - We don't learn by trying to *put information into our heads*
          - We *learn* by attempting to retrieve information *from* our heads
          - *(pause)*
          - Who has heard the expression "you learn by doing" **(click)**... you really *do* learn by *doing*: you learn by trying to take information out of your head and apply it
          - Which is tricky because when you're new to something, the thing you're **not yet good at** is *the doing*
          - You can make this problem of **not knowing** a little less intimidating by **encouraging your learner to make mistakes**
        </aside>

          <li class="fragment">"What have you tried so far?"</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Making mistakes involves a *process* of considering what *might be* a correct answer and *what isn't*... and then *trying it out*
          - The process of trying, failing, and trying again is a *learning* process
          - I don't just want you to just carve out a space where making mistakes is okay, I actually want you to actively *encourage* **(click)** making mistakes
          - When doing this you could say things like ...
            - **(click)** "I don't know, give it a try" (which is code for "let's make a mistake together")
            - Or **(click)** "what have you tried so far?" (which means "what mistakes have you made so made so far")
          - ...
          - So after your learners have made mistakes and they've found themselves stuck, I want you...

        <h3 class="fragment"><em>Make the answers sticky</em></h3>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - To not answer any questions... I'm kidding.  You need to help them, that's sort of your job. **(click)** 
          - But I want you to be *careful* when answering questions
          - It's going to be hard to remember that **you shouldn't be telling**, **(click)** you should be teaching **(click)**
          - So when you answer questions, you want your answers to be *sticky* **(click)**
          - Make an analogy, even if it's a bad one.  If it's memorable, it's good enough.
          - If you thought up a dance that demonstrates the way dictionaries work, do it.  I don't know what it would look like, but it would probably be memorable.
          - Make your answers **sticky**
          - And if you can, it's nice to avoid being the source of information.  Instead of answering questions directly, point your learners in the right direction...

        <h2><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index=1>Delegate to Google</span></h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - By looking things up in the documentation
          - Or more realistically, in Google **(click)**
          - If you're sitting next to someone who you're coaching and they ask "why am I getting this error message?" instead of saying "ah ha, I know the answer", say "let's look it up"
          - *You* are a resource for your learner, but **you're not their only resource**
          - You want to delegate to other sources of information that are more accessible at 2am... or over the weekend
          - So making mistakes together is important and looking things up together is important...
          - But sometimes you really just need...

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO shorten and clarify this section
          - The idea with rubber duck debugging is that if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck... actually that's something else
          - If you have a problem, maybe you're debugging your code, talking to your rubber duck can help
          - The duck doesn't talk back, but it listens very well and it encourages you to elaborate on your problem, which is a process that can help you uncover ideas that you haven't explored yet
          - I want you to do a lot more listening to your learner, than talking
          - Encourage elaborating on the problem at hand
          - If your learner says **(click)** "my code doesn't work" you could ask **(click)** what they expect it to do and**(click)**  what it does instead and then follow that up by asking them **(click)** to explain the approach they're taking
          - Elaboration is a great way to learn

          - So being a learning ally is important, but this isn't just an intellectual pursuit.  This is an emotional experience.
          - Your learner will be displaying their *lack of knowledge* to you all the time, which means they're going to feel vulnerable... which hard

          - That your learner feels that they can trust you
          - You need to build trust with your learner, so they'll be comfortable being vulnerable with you
          - One big way you can build trust, is ...
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>Be Vulnerable</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">Telling bad jokes</li>

          <li class="fragment">Saying "I don't know"</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - To find a way to make yourself vulnerable
          - There are a lot of ways to be vulnerable
          - For example, I make bad jokes **(click)**.  They're not usually not very funny and that makes me a little bit vulnerable.
          - I also make mistakes **(click)**, sometimes on purpose and most of the time on accident.  But I don't ever "ah I did that on purpose to test you".  I want my learners to *feel* my fallibility.
          - Another big way to be vulnerable is by saying *"I. don't. know"* **(click)**
            - I don't know, but **let's try it out**
            - Or... I'm not sure, **let's look it up**
          - Admitting you don't know is very important for building trust
          - ...
          - These are just 3 ways to be more vulnerable
          - And vulnerability is a big way to build trust... but it's not the only way
          - Another big factor in being trusted is **considering the way you that speak**
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>Speak Deliberately</h2>

          <li class="fragment">"What will happen when we run this?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">"What do you think will happen when we run this?"</li>
          <li class="fragment">"What do you think might happen when we run this?  What's your guess?"</li>
        </ol>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Here's 4 ways to say almost the same thing...
          - **4 Clicks**
          - Which of these is the most welcoming?  I would say number 4.
          - Those first and second ones sound kind of like a pop quiz
          - You *do* want to encourage information retrieval, but you don't want to make it **feel like a quiz**: you want to invite your learners *to guess* and *to make mistakes*
          - Confident and assertive language is often counter-productive when you're coaching someone through a problem
          - So I want you to think less about what you're saying and more about *what might be heard*
          - And if possible, I want you to be **encouraging**

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - There are a lot of ways you can alienate you learners, in big ways and in small ways
          - "So obviously" **(click)**: many things are **not obvious** when you're learning
          - "Of course" **(click)**: when you're new to something, there aren't many "of course" situations
          - "It's easy, you just" **(click)**: it's easy for you, it's not easy if you don't know it yet
          - What's in your head as a mentor, is not in your learners head
          - What's easy for you, is not easy for your learner.  It's hard.
          - Your learner doesn't yet know the same things you do, because you're further along in the process of learning
          - ... *(breathe)*
          - ...

      <section>
        <h2>Believe in your learners</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO make these speaker notes better. Visual and analogy with female characters in movie where belief was key (there was or wasn't belief in abilities)
          - If you don't believe in your learner's ability to improve, they are less likely to improve their skills
          - Who has heard of the growth mindset?
          - If you adopt a growth mindset you believe that through directed effort, you can and you will improve your skills: that your skills aren't fixed but are expandable
          - There's research that backs up the idea that you're more likely to learn if you adopt a growth mindset: you're more likely to grow your skills if you believe in your ability to do so
          - Your belief in your learner is *also very important*: it's hard for your learner to believe in themselves, if you don't believe in them
          - They come from a baseline of understanding that's below yours: you can't judge that baseline, you just **have to believe** that they'll build up from where they're at
          - You need to convince yourself of your learner's abilities and give them the impression, explicitly or implicitly, that you believe in them
        </aside>

      <section>
        <h2>Build Trust</h2>

          <li class="fragment">Encourage, don't alienate</li>

        </ul>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO check these
          - So building trust involves
            - Being vulnerable
            - Speaking deliberately
            - Which involves making sure you're being encouraging and not alienating
            - And believing in the ability your learner has, to learn.  Believing in their potential and their capacity to grow themselves.
          - ...
          - So to recap, you want to be an learning ally, not an expert
          - You also want to be want to build trust so your learner will be comfortable with you
          - The last thing I want to talk about is a way for you to improve your own mentoring abilities and to learn from yourself as you go
          - The last thing you need to do...

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Is slow down
          - *(long pause)*
          - *(continued pause)*
          - TODO more pauses like this: June said so
          - I want you to slow down...
            - your thinking
            - your speaking
            - and your actions
          - *Especially* when you're in a situation where you're *not* quite sure *how* to act
        </aside>

        <h2>Reflect</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO visual
          - **Act with intention**: try to *empathize* with what your learner might be feeling
          - When you speak, *question* **what you're saying** and **why you're saying it**
          - ...
          - It can sometimes be a little distracting to reflect *too much*, but *try* to spend a bit of time reflecting... so that you can improve your coaching style
          - *Reflection* is a very *important* part of learning, and *you* are also learning

          <li class="fragment"><span class="fragment strike">Some code that's poorly styled, but syntactically valid</span></li>

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - Let's say your learner says: "my code doesn't work"
          - They show you the code, and you see 4 things:
            - **(click)** A function that's improperly named
            - **(click)** Code that's a little ugly, but it works
            - **(click)** Something that seems like a logical error: a misunderstanding in the actual problem you're solving
            - **(click)** And a syntax error: something that stops the code from running at all
          - Which one of these do you focus on?
          - The answer is whichever one is currently most important to your learner
          - Unless they're asking you about code style, that's not the most pressing issue of these four: that's a discussion *for some other time*
          - The most important *right now* is often the one that Python is *complaining* about: which is probably the syntax error **(click)**
          - You don't want to distract your learner: so just focus on *the one thing* that's important *right now*.  And then stop.  *The rest* can come later.
          - TODO one thing priority visual then stop sign visual?

        <h2 class="fragment">Learn About Learning</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO visuals
          - One thing you should consider doing, is learning **(click)** about learning
          - I recommend learning about the best practices around learning
          - This is useful for you because *you* are learning
          - But it'll also be useful to share these concepts with your learner
            - Talk about the growth mindset
            - And talk about the fact that you learn by retrieving information from your head, not by putting it into your head
          - This discussion is a *moment* for you, but *it's a lifetime* for your learner

        <h2 class="fragment strike" data-fragment-index=1>Fake it until you make it</h2>
        <h2 class="fragment" data-fragment-index=1>Adopt a growth mindset</h2>
        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO improve these notes
          - "Fake it until you make it"
          - I don't really like this phrase: I don't really like the connotation... but there is truth behind this idea
          - If you *slow yourself down* and think "if I were a *really good* mentor", you're sort of pretending you're a good mentor... you're faking it
          - But in the process you're trying to act deliberately, you're acting with intention
          - But you're also practicing, which is *part* of learning
          - As you continue to deliberately act a certain way, you'll eventually start to intuitively that act that way
          - Remember the growth mindset **(click)**
          - Mental ability can be learned.  **Thoughfulness**, **empathy**... are learned skills.  **Friendliness**... is a learned skill.
          - Congratulating your learners and feeling excited on their behalf... that's learned too.

        <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
          - TODO improve these notes
          - So I want you to slow yourself down: slow your thinking, speaking, and acting
          - I want you to take things one step at a time: don't distract yourself or your learner by jumping ahead of the one thing that's important right now
          - And I want you to learn a bit about learning itself so that you can help your learners move toward their goals more deliberately
          - I also want you to adopt a growth mindset, not just for your learner's sake but for your sake
          - You can grow your own skills by faking it until you make it
            - If you see a trait you like in someone else, steal it.  It's yours.
          - Whatever being a good mentor means to you, you can move in that direction if you put *your mind* to it
